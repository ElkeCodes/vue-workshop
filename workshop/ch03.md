# Chapter 03: Creating the Clients page

We now have an application with a page, a collapsible sidenav and a header.
Let's now add some content!
Open `views/Clients.vue` and change it to the following code:

```vue
<template>
  <div class="pl-6 pr-6 divide-y divide-gray-400">
    <div class="relative">
      <h1 class="pt-6 pb-6 text-xl">Clients</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="pt-6">
      <ClientsTable></ClientsTable>
    </div>
  </div>
</template>

<script lang="ts">
import { defineComponent } from "vue";
import ClientsTable from "../components/clients/ClientsTable.vue";

export default defineComponent({
  components: {
    ClientsTable,
  },
});
</script>
```

You'll see in the source code a `ClientsTable` component, let's create that as well in `/src/components/clients/ClientsTable.vue`:

```vue
<template>
  <table class="table-auto w-full">
    <thead>
      <tr class="bg-gray-200">
        <th class="border px-4 py-2 text-left">Id</th>
        <th class="border px-4 py-2 text-left">Name</th>
        <th class="border px-4 py-2 text-left"></th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr v-for="client in clients">
        <td class="border px-4 py-2">{{ client.id }}</td>
        <td class="border px-4 py-2">
          {{ client.firstName }} {{ client.lastName }}
        </td>
        <td class="border px-4 py-2">
          Actions
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</template>

<script lang="ts">
import { defineComponent } from "vue";
import { Client } from "../../models/Client";

export default defineComponent({
  name: "ClientsTable",
  props: {
    clients: Array as PropType<Client[]>,
  },
});
</script>
```

This is the first time we see a more advanced version of `props`.
Vue provides us with a lot of basic types for our props such as `String`, `Boolean`, `Array`, ...
But if we want to be more specific on the types, we can use `as PropType<X>` with X as our own type.
So let's create a `Client` interface and lets place it in a new folder called `models`:

```ts
export interface Client {
  id?: number;
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  email: string;
  birthday: string;
  city: string;
  zip: string;
}
```

We'll use that folder for all our models in the application.
Thanks to a `models` folder, we'll have a clean overview of all the models that we can use.

We can now adapt the `<ClientsTable></ClientsTable>` line to `<ClientsTable :clients="clients"></ClientsTable>` to fill in our table with actual data.
But we'll need to provide some content for this clients variable in `Clients.vue`.
Let's add `data` and a method to retrieve the clients in `Clients.vue`:

```ts
data() {
  return {
    clients: [],
  };
},
methods: {
  loadClients() {
    fetch("https://base-app-backend.herokuapp.com/clients")
      .then((response) => response.json())
      .then((clients) => (this.clients = clients));
  },
},
```

Just as with `data`; `methods` will be available in our `template` and `script`.
We can put all kinds of functions in there such as calculations, data retrieval, data manipulation and so on.

We now have a method to load the clients, but how does Vue know that it needs to call it?
We'll add a manual call in a special method from Vue called `created`.
Created is one of the many lifecycle hooks.
The reason that we add a call to backend in `created` is to speed things up.
Created is called when the component is created in the virual DOM but not yet mounted in the actual DOM, thus we avoid an unnecessary delay.

You can add it to our Clients component:

```ts
created() {
  this.loadClients();
},
```

If you now open /clients, you should see a list of clients.
