# Chapter 04: Creating a client

So currently we can show data but we also want to manipulate it.
Let's start with being able to create a client via a new page.

## Creating the component

Create a new file `views/CreateClient.vue`:

```html
<template>
  <div class="pl-6 pr-6 divide-y divide-gray-400">
    <div class="relative">
      <h1 class="pt-6 pb-6 text-xl">Create client</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="pt-6">
    </div>
  </div>
</template>

<script lang="ts">
import { defineComponent } from "vue";

export default defineComponent({
  name: "CreateClient"
});
</script>
```

Add it to the router definition by extending the routes array with an extra element:

```ts
// import the new page
import CreateClient from "./views/CreateClient.vue";

// add to the routes:
{
	path: "/clients/create",
	name: "createClient",
	component: CreateClient,
},
```

Now when you surf to `/clients/create`, you should see the text "Create client" in your browser.

To create a client, we'll request the user to fill in a form.
Because we know we'll add the functionality to edit a client, we'll create a more generic form that will allow us to create and edit a client.

## Creating the ClientForm component

Let's create `components/clients/ClientForm.vue`:

```html
<template>
  <form class="w-full" @submit.prevent>
    <div class="flex items-center mb-6">
      <div class="w-1/4">
        <label
          class="block text-gray-500 font-bold md:text-right mb-1 md:mb-0 pr-4"
          >First name</label
        >
      </div>
      <div class="w-3/4">
        <input
          class="
            bg-gray-200 appearance-none border-2 border-gray-200 rounded w-full
            py-2 px-4 text-gray-700 leading-tight focus:outline-none
            focus:bg-white focus:border-primary-500
          "
          type="text"
          name="firstName"
        />
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="flex items-center mb-6">
      <div class="w-1/4">
        <label
          class="block text-gray-500 font-bold md:text-right mb-1 md:mb-0 pr-4"
          >Last name</label
        >
      </div>
      <div class="w-3/4">
        <input
          class="
            bg-gray-200 appearance-none border-2 border-gray-200 rounded w-full
            py-2 px-4 text-gray-700 leading-tight focus:outline-none
            focus:bg-white focus:border-primary-500
          "
          type="text"
          name="lastName"
        />
      </div>
    </div>
  </form>
</template>
```

Add the fields for the remaining Client data: email, birthday, city and ZIP.
We'll optimise this further in one of the next chapters.

Let's end the form with a submit and cancel button:

```html
<div class="flex items-center">
  <div class="md:w-1/4"></div>
  <div class="md:w-3/4 flex">
    <div>
      <button
        type="submit"
        class="
          bg-primary-500 text-white font-bold
          py-2 px-4 rounded hover:bg-primary-700
        "
        @click="onSubmit"
      >
        Save
      </button>
    </div>
    <button
      type="button"
      class="
        bg-transparent hover:bg-primary-700 border border-primary-500
        ml-4 py-2 px-4 rounded
      "
      @click="onCancel"
    >
      Cancel
    </button>
  </div>
</div>
```

If you now open your browser, you'll see the form.
But it's not yet working, let's add some functionality.

You might have noticed that on our submit and cancel button, we've already added an @click event.
Let's create those in our `ClientForm` component while also adding a prop for our client:

```ts
<script lang="ts">
import { defineComponent } from "vue";
import { Client } from "../../models/Client";

export default defineComponent({
  props: {
    client: {
      type: Object as () => Client,
      required: true,
    },
  },
  emits: ["submit", "cancel"],
  methods: {
    onSubmit() {
      this.$emit("submit", this.client);
    },
    onCancel() {
      this.$emit("cancel");
    },
  },
});
</script>
```

The goal of our form is to send a client object to it, let the user possibly edit it and then when it gets submitted, send the new client object back to the parent component.
Our ClientForm will be used in our CreateClient component and in the future also our EditClient component.

## Using the ClientForm component

So how do we actually use the new `ClientForm` component?
Well, we add ClientForm in our CreateClient component:

```ts
// in the template tag
<client-form
  :client="client"
  @submit="saveClient"
  @cancel="returnToClients"
/>

// in the script tag
import ClientForm from "../components/clients/ClientForm.vue";

components: {
  ClientForm,
},
```

So we need to create two methods.
`returnToClients` is one where we use the router to navigate back to the clients page.
Remember that we used a named route? We can now reuse that.
But instead of using a router-link, we can also do programmatic navigation by calling `this.$router.push(...)` which can accept a `to` object just like router-link.
The other method is `saveClient` which accepts the client object that is sent along in our submit event and does a POST to our backend.
After we get a reply, we redirect to the clients page by reusing our `returnToClients` function.

We also initialise our data with a new client.
This is for example the perfect place to add default values but let's use empty variables for the moment.

```ts
data() {
  return {
    client: {
      firstName: "",
      lastName: "",
      email: "",
      birthday: "",
      city: "",
      zip: "",
    } as Client,
  };
},
methods: {
  returnToClients() {
    this.$router.push({ name: "clients" });
  },
  saveClient(client: Client) {
    fetch("https://base-app-backend.herokuapp.com/clients", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(client),
    }).then(this.returnToClients);
  },
},
```

So ok we create a client, we can accept a filled in client object to save it and we have a working cancel button.
But if you try to fill in the form, you'll see it won't work as we're missing actual binding of our client object properties to our form.
Our form elements don't know that their value needs to be filled in into a client object.
We can achieve this by adding v-model directly to our input tags.

For example firstname:

```html
<input
  class="bg-gray-200 appearance-none border-2 border-gray-200 rounded w-full py-2 px-4 text-gray-700 leading-tight focus:outline-none focus:bg-white focus:border-primary-500"
  type="text"
  name="firstName"
/>
```

becomes:

```html
<input
  class="bg-gray-200 appearance-none border-2 border-gray-200 rounded w-full py-2 px-4 text-gray-700 leading-tight focus:outline-none focus:bg-white focus:border-primary-500"
  type="text"
  name="firstName"
  v-model="client.firstName"
/>
```

Do the same for all fields in `ClientForm`.
If you put a v-model on an input tag, it will always be filled in with the value that the user enters.
Or if you would change the value in your code, it will be shown in the input field.

After you've filled this all in, try submitting the form.

## Adding a link to our CreateClient page

We have now our `CreateClient` page but unless you know the URL, you'll not be able to use it.
We'll add a button in the top part of our Clients page that links to the `CreateClient` page.
Add the following behind our h1 tag:

```html
<div class="absolute top-0 right-0">
  <router-link
    :to="{ name: 'createClient' }"
    class="mt-5 bg-primary-500 hover:bg-primary-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded block"
  >
    Add
  </router-link>
</div>
```
