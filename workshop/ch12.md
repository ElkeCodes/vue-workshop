# Chapter 12: extending the store

A common usecase for Vuex is to use it to bundle all your API calls and get an overview of all the data that's needed in your application.

We've created a very basic store and now we'll extend it further to gather all calls related to clients.

First, create a `/src/store` folder and move `store.ts` in there.
Rename it to `index.ts`.

## Creating a clients module

Let's create a new file `/src/store/clients.ts` with the following contents:

```ts
import { Module } from "vuex";
import { GlobalState } from ".";
import { Client, defaultClient } from "../models/Client";

const clientsApiURL = "https://base-app-backend.herokuapp.com/clients";

export interface ClientsState {
  clients: Client[];
  client?: Client;
}

export const clientsModule: Module<ClientsState, GlobalState> = {
  namespaced: true,
  state: (): ClientsState => ({
    clients: [],
    client: defaultClient,
  }),
  mutations: {
    setClients(state: ClientsState, clients: Client[]) {
      state.clients = clients;
    },
  },
  actions: {
    loadClients({ commit }) {
      return fetch(clientsApiURL)
        .then((response) => response.json())
        .then((clients) => commit("setClients", clients));
    },
  },
};
```

What we've currently added is provide an action to load the clients, a mutation to set them and keep them in our state.

We also adapted our Clients model file with a `defaultClient` const that we will use if we need to reset things:

```ts
export interface Client {
  id?: number;
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  email: string;
  birthday: string;
  city: string;
  zip: string;
}

export const defaultClient: Client = {
  firstName: "",
  lastName: "",
  email: "",
  birthday: "",
  city: "",
  zip: "",
};
```

Now we need to add the module to our store by adding in our `createStore` object in `/src/store/index.ts`:

```ts
modules: {
  clients: clientsModule,
},
```

Don't forget to import it with `import { clientsModule } from "./clients";`

## Using the loadClients action

The next thing we'll do is clean up our `Clients` component.
We can remove the `data` as all our data will be coming from the store.
We add in our `computed` a `...mapState("clients", ["clients"])` to integrate the clients object comfing form the clients module.
And we remove the `loadClients` method and adapt our `created` to:

```ts
created() {
  this.$store.dispatch("clients/loadClients");
},
```

By passing "clients/loadClients" to the dispatch method, we let Vuex know that it should call the `loadClients` function in the `clients` module.

Our script tag in `Clients` is getting a bit cleaner:

```vue
<script lang="ts">
import { defineComponent } from "vue";
import ClientsTable from "../components/clients/ClientsTable.vue";
import { mapGetters, mapState } from "vuex";

export default defineComponent({
  components: {
    ClientsTable,
  },
  computed: {
    ...mapGetters(["isUnlocked"]),
    ...mapState("clients", ["clients"]),
  },
  methods: {
    editClient(id) {
      this.$router.push({
        name: "editClient",
        params: { id },
      });
    },
    deleteClient(id) {
      if (window.confirm("Are you sure?")) {
        fetch(`https://base-app-backend.herokuapp.com/clients/${id}`, {
          method: "DELETE",
        }).then(() => this.loadClients());
      }
    },
  },
  created() {
    this.$store.dispatch("clients/loadClients");
  },
});
</script>
```

You'll see that the clients get loaded.
But now we have an error when we try to delete a client.
Let's fix that.

## Creating a deleteClient action

Let's move the delete functionality to our store by creating a `deleteClient` action:

```ts
deleteClient({ dispatch }, id: number) {
  return fetch(`${clientsApiURL}/${id}`, {
    method: "DELETE",
  }).then(() => dispatch("loadClients"));
},
```

You'll see that we can add the loading of clients when the call is done in there.
Now our components don't need to handle the reloading of the clients anymore.
The `Clients` component will just focus on showing the `clients` coming from our store without having to worry if a reload is necessary.

Let's update `Clients` accordingly to a cleaner version:

```vue
<script lang="ts">
import { defineComponent } from "vue";
import ClientsTable from "../components/clients/ClientsTable.vue";
import { mapGetters, mapState } from "vuex";

export default defineComponent({
  components: {
    ClientsTable,
  },
  computed: {
    ...mapGetters(["isUnlocked"]),
    ...mapState("clients", ["clients"]),
  },
  methods: {
    editClient(id) {
      this.$router.push({
        name: "editClient",
        params: { id },
      });
    },
    deleteClient(id) {
      if (window.confirm("Are you sure?")) {
        this.$store.dispatch("clients/deleteClient", id);
      }
    },
  },
  created() {
    this.$store.dispatch("clients/loadClients");
  },
});
</script>
```

## Creating the createClient action

We create a new action in our `clients` module:

```ts
createClient({ commit }, client: Client) {
  return fetch(clientsApiURL, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(client),
  }).then(() => commit("setClient", defaultClient));
},
```

We can then simplify our `saveClient` method in `CreateClient`:

```ts
saveClient(client: Client) {
  this.$store
    .dispatch("clients/createClient", client)
    .then(this.returnToClients);
},
```

With the introduction of `defaultClient`, let's simplify `data` as well:

```ts
import { defaultClient } from "../models/Client";

data() {
  return {
    client: { ...defaultClient },
  };
},
```

## Creating the editClient action

We create two new actions in our `clients` module:

```ts
loadClient({ commit }, id: number) {
  return fetch(`${clientsApiURL}/${id}`)
    .then((response) => response.json())
    .then((client) => commit("setClient", client));
},
editClient({ commit }, client: Client) {
  return fetch(`${clientsApiURL}/${client.id}`, {
    method: "PUT",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(client),
  }).then(() => commit("setClient", defaultClient));
},
```

And in our `EditClient` component, we'll need to adapt our script tag to:

- load the client from the state
- call the loadClient action to fill in the client into the state
- call the editClient action to actually save any changes

The endresult should look like this:

```vue
<script lang="ts">
import { defineComponent } from "vue";
import { mapState } from "vuex";
import ClientForm from "../components/clients/ClientForm.vue";

export default defineComponent({
  name: "EditClient",
  components: {
    ClientForm,
  },
  props: {
    id: {
      type: Number,
      required: true,
    },
  },
  computed: {
    ...mapState("clients", ["client"]),
  },
  created() {
    this.$store.dispatch("clients/loadClient", this.$props.id);
  },
  methods: {
    returnToClients() {
      this.$router.push({ name: "clients" });
    },
    editClient(client: Client): Promise<Response> {
      this.$store
        .dispatch("clients/editClient", client)
        .then(this.returnToClients);
    },
  },
});
</script>
```

## Conclusion

That was a big chapter on Vuex.
But we've now moved all API calls into a clean store which will help maintenance.
And as a bonus, we were able to clean up our components a lot by using less code.
