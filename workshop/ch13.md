# Chapter 13: Products

We've made all our Clients functionality, are you now able to create the Products functionality?

We'll need:

- Products page
- CreateProduct page
- EditProduct page
- DeleteProduct functionality
- Use the store to get and save product data
- Validation on the name and product code, those should be filled in
- Id can not be changed so should not be available in the form

Here's the Product interface that you can use:

```ts
export interface Product {
  id?: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  productCode: string;
}
```

Good luck!

If you would get stuck, the solution can be found in chapter 14.
