## Chapter 00: Setup

Let us start by executing the following commands to create our project:

```
yarn create @vitejs/app vue-base-app --template vue-ts
cd vue-base-app
yarn
```

What this command does is initialise a Vue TypeScript project with Vite as our build tool.
Vite (French word for "fast", pronounced /vit/) is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.
It uses Rollup to build your code while also providing a lean dev server that works native ES modules and Hot Module Replacement and more.
If you want to use a more traditional build tool like webpack, you can always use the Vue CLI which was the default for Vue 2.
But with the release of Vue 3, we will focus on Vite.

After initialising our Vue 3 project with Vite, we will also install Tailwind:

```
yarn add -D tailwindcss@latest postcss@latest autoprefixer@latest
```

And after that we must create our Tailwind configuration files:

```
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

This will create a minimal tailwind.config.js file at the root of your project:

```// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  purge: [],
  darkMode: false, // or 'media' or 'class'
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

Let's override the theme part with the Ordina colors:

```
module.exports = {
  purge: [],
  darkMode: false, // or 'media' or 'class'
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        primary: {
          100: "#ebf8ff",
          200: "#bee3f8",
          //ordina color
          300: "#E37C30",
          400: "#63b3ed",
          //ordina color
          500: "#E7904B",
          600: "#3182ce",
          //ordina color
          700: "#EAB285",
          800: "#2c5282",
          //ordina color
          900: "#F7D1A7",
        },
      },
    },
  },
  variants: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

Now that we've configured Tailwind, let's add it to our styling.
Create a file /src/index.css:

```
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

Which we'll then include into our `main.ts` by adding: 

```
import "./index.css";
```

Let's now clean up the generated files by Vue a bit.
You can remove the complete /src/components folder.
And the contents of App.vue can be changed to:

```
<template>
  <h1 class="text-primary-500">Hello Bold!</h1>
</template>
```

Here we have the most basic component you can have in Vue: only HTML.
If you run the project with `yarn dev`, you should see an orange coloured text "Hello Bold!".
This means that our Tailwind configuration was succesful and that we've just created the very basics for our project.
