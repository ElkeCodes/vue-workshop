# Chapter 11: Adding a store

Let's say we want to add a locking mechanism to basically make our app read-only unless it is unlocked.
Because of this, we'll need some shared data, one of the use cases for a store in Vue.
There are multiple implementations for a store in Vue, with the most popular one being Vuex, which we'll use.

## Install Vuex

```
yarn add vuex@next --save
```

## How Vuex works

There are 4 main concepts in a Vuex store that everybody uses:

- state: a big object representing the state of your application
- getters: very similar to computed from a component, they are used to retrieve (transformed) data out of the store
- mutations: functions to modify the state of a store. Only actions can call mutations
- actions: functions that commit mutations and can contain any number of asynchronuous operations. They are the public API to trigger changes in the store

These can be bundled into modules: a grouping of state, getters, mutations and actions specific for a certain concept.
For example in our current application we could have 2 modules:

- global
- clients

## Creating the store

Let's make `/src/store.ts`:

```ts
import { createLogger, createStore } from "vuex";

export const store = createStore({
  plugins: import.meta.env.NODE_ENV !== "production" ? [createLogger()] : [],
});
```

We add the `createLogger` plugin to have some logging in our console during development.

Then we have to adapt our `main.ts` to:

```ts
import { createApp } from "vue";
import App from "./App.vue";
import { router } from "./routes";
import { store } from "./store";
import "./index.css";

createApp(App).use(router).use(store).mount("#app");
```

So that the store is added in our application and will be available everywhere.
Vuex will add `$store` in all components.
So inside the `script` tags you'll be able to access `this.$store`.

## Creating the global state

We have to define that we will have a global state that contains one variable: `isReadOnly`.
To adapt it, we'll need an action `toggleLock` that will call the mutation `toggleLock`.
That mutation will adapt the actual state.
We'll also add a couple of helper getters:

```ts
import { createLogger, createStore } from "vuex";

export interface GlobalState {
  isReadOnly: boolean;
}

export const store = createStore({
  state: (): GlobalState => ({
    isReadOnly: true,
  }),
  getters: {
    isLocked(state: GlobalState) {
      return state.isReadOnly;
    },
    isUnlocked(state: GlobalState) {
      return !state.isReadOnly;
    },
  },
  mutations: {
    toggleLock(state: GlobalState) {
      state.isReadOnly = !state.isReadOnly;
    },
  },
  actions: {
    toggleLock({ commit }) {
      commit("toggleLock");
    },
  },
  plugins: import.meta.env.NODE_ENV !== "production" ? [createLogger()] : [],
});
```

So we have a state, which just as a component data is a function to ensure it's always a clean object.
We have 2 getters defined to easily extract data.
And we have an action that calls our mutation to update the lock.

So how do we actually use this?
Vuex provides us with a couple of nice helpers: `mapState()`, `mapGetters()` and `mapActions()`.

## Adding the Lock component

Let's first create a `Lock` component:

```vue
<template>
  <svg
    class="ml-auto cursor-pointer inline-block"
    width="28px"
    height="28px"
    viewBox="0 0 32 32"
  >
    <path
      v-if="isLocked"
      d="M15 21.915v0c-0.583-0.206-1-0.762-1-1.415 0-0.828 0.672-1.5 1.5-1.5s1.5 0.672 1.5 1.5c0 0.653-0.417 1.209-1 1.415v2.594c0 0.263-0.224 0.491-0.5 0.491-0.268 0-0.5-0.22-0.5-0.491v-2.594zM8 14v0 0c-1.658 0.005-3 1.34-3 3.009v9.981c0 1.662 1.346 3.009 3.009 3.009h14.982c1.662 0 3.009-1.337 3.009-3.009v-9.981c0-1.659-1.341-3.005-3-3.009v-3.501c0-4.142-3.366-7.499-7.5-7.499-4.142 0-7.5 3.357-7.5 7.499v3.501zM11 14v-3.499c0-2.492 2.015-4.501 4.5-4.501 2.48 0 4.5 2.015 4.5 4.501v3.499h-9z"
      style="fill: white"
    ></path>
    <path
      v-else
      d="M20 23.915v2.594c0 0.271 0.232 0.491 0.5 0.491 0.276 0 0.5-0.228 0.5-0.491v-2.594c0.583-0.206 1-0.762 1-1.415 0-0.828-0.672-1.5-1.5-1.5s-1.5 0.672-1.5 1.5c0 0.653 0.417 1.209 1 1.415v0 0zM13 8.5c0-2.485-2.020-4.5-4.5-4.5-2.485 0-4.5 2.017-4.5 4.5v3.999c0 0.822-0.672 1.501-1.5 1.501-0.834 0-1.5-0.672-1.5-1.501v-4c0-4.143 3.358-7.499 7.5-7.499 4.134 0 7.5 3.358 7.5 7.499v7.501h11.991c1.663 0 3.009 1.347 3.009 3.009v9.981c0 1.673-1.347 3.009-3.009 3.009h-14.982c-1.663 0-3.009-1.347-3.009-3.009v-9.981c0-1.67 1.342-3.005 3-3.009v-7.5z"
      style="fill: white"
    ></path>
  </svg>
</template>

<script lang="ts">
import { defineComponent } from "vue";

export default defineComponent({
  props: {
    isLocked: {
      type: Boolean,
      default: true,
    },
  },
});
</script>
```

As you can see, a very basic component that takes a prop to switch which SVG path to show.

And we can use it in our `Header` component:

```html
<h1 class="pl-3">Hello Bold!</h1>
<lock :isLocked="isLocked" @click="toggleLock"></lock>
```

And you can adapt the script tag:

```ts
import { mapGetters, mapActions } from "vuex";
import Lock from "./Lock.vue";

export default defineComponent({
  // ...
  components: {
    Lock,
  },
  computed: {
    ...mapGetters(["isLocked"]),
  },
  methods: {
    ...mapActions(["toggleLock"]),
  },
});
```

Thanks to the `mapGetters` and `mapActions`, we can take certain parts of our store and integrate them into our components.
`isLocked` will become a `computed` property of our component and `toggleLock` a method that we can call in our component.

## Using the state

So we have our `Lock` component but how do we use the state that we are setting?
Well we can integrate our `isLocked` getter on 2 places to "disable" certain functionality unless the application is unlocked.

The first one is to disable our action menu.
We adapt the "Actions" button in `ActionMenu` by changing it to:

```html
<button
  type="button"
  @click="isMenuOpened = !isMenuOpened"
  :disabled="isLocked"
  :class="{ 'cursor-not-allowed': isLocked }"
>
  Actions
  <span aria-hidden="true">â–¾</span>
</button>
```

And we add in the `ActionMenu` script:

```ts
import { mapGetters } from "vuex";

computed: {
  ...mapGetters(["isLocked"]),
},
```

You'll see that the Actions button to trigger the ActionMenu will be disabled if the Lock is locked.

Let's adapt the Add button that brings us to `CreateClient` so that it's only visible if the lock is unlocked by using our `isUnlocked` getter:

```html
<router-link
  :to="{ name: 'createClient' }"
  class="
    mt-5 bg-primary-500 hover:bg-primary-700 text-white font-bold
    py-2 px-4 rounded block
  "
  v-if="isUnlocked"
>
  Add
</router-link>
```

And we add in the `Clients` script:

```ts
import { mapGetters } from "vuex";

computed: {
  ...mapGetters(["isUnlocked"]),
},
```

Thus we now have a basic store that provides us a shared state.
There is no need to provide all kinds of communication via other components to change for example the visibility of the Add button.
