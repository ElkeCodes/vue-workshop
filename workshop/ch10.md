# Chapter 10: Deleting a client

We have the create client and edit client functionality, now it's time for the delete client.

Let's add again a `click` handler to the action menu, more specifically to the `Delete` button:

```
<button type="button" @click="$emit('delete:client', client.id)">Delete</button>
```

Let's capture that in the `Clients` component by adding to the `<ClientsTable />` tag:

```
@delete:client="deleteClient"
```

Feel free to add "delete:client" to the emits setting of ClientsTable.

And finally add to our methods in `Clients`: 

```
deleteClient(id) {
  if (window.confirm("Are you sure?")) {
    fetch(`https://base-app-backend.herokuapp.com/clients/${id}`, {
      method: "DELETE",
    }).then(() => this.loadClients());
  }
},
```

Small addition: we now have the situation that the ActionMenu stays open if you were to click "No" on the prompt "Are you sure?". 
We can solve this by adding: 

```
@click="closeMenu"
```

To the div with the `v-if="isMenuOpened"` in AtionMenu.
